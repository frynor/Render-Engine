# Terminal Render Engine in C

**Terminal Render Engine in C** is a minimalist, high-performance graphics engine written entirely in C that renders 3D scenes directly to the terminal. I wanted it to be simple and yet efficent engine that would demonstrate fundamental concepts of computer graphics, including vectors and matrices, quaternions, double buffering, rasterization, and camera perspective projection-all without relying on **external graphics library.**

### Features

- **Pure C Implementation:** Only standard C and terminal libraries.
- **Mathematics Engine:** Operations with vertices, matrices, quaternions and more.
- **Double Buffering:** Smooth animations with two framebuffers.
- **Rasterization:** Efficient triangle rasterization directly in terminal.
- **Camera & Perspective:** Custom camera system with perspective projection.
